The number 42 has no significant meaning as it is just a common placeholder used to indicate a seed of randomness. However, it’s interesting to note that the number 42 comes from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy where 42 is said to be the answer to all things. Finally, stratify=Y is a parameter that ensures the proportion of the categories in the ‘Category’ column are proportional. For instance, if ‘Fruits & Vegetables’ take up 90% of the entire category and ‘Household’ take up 10%, then both the training and test sets will have a similar 90%/10% split. This is essential as it prevents the data from having an imbalanced proportion of each category."

The RandomOverSampler over-samples the minority classes by duplicating samples from it. Because the oversample only works with input X to be 2D, I convert the train data into a 2D array, or a DataFrame. Then, I create an oversample object which looks at my training labels and analyzes which categories have fewer samples, duplicating them until all classes have equal data points.

    "TF-IDF, standing for Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency, is one of the most common methods of converting text into numbers to be used for machine learning. TF outputs a number based on how often the word appears in the data. IDF analyzes how rare a word is out of the entire dataset. TF-IDF is then calculated by multiplying those two scores together.\n",
    "\n",
    "I create a TF-IDF vectorizer with two settings: ngram_range=(1,2) telling the vectorizer to extract product names with one to two words such as ‘apple juice’, and max_features=5000 telling the vectorizer to keep only the top 5000 most important n-grams based on frequency to help prevent overfitting and unnecessary noise from rare words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I use .fit_transform() to analyze all text in X_train_over and learn the vocabulary, and convert each product name into a numeric vector. .transform() then applies the trained vocabulary to my test set. Test data words not in the training vocabulary are ignored.\n"

If the category is already written down, the grocery item gets placed underneath the corresponding category in the form of a [vertical flexbox](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/7.6.3/examples/Widget%20Styling.html); whereas, if the category is new, a new category box is created."
